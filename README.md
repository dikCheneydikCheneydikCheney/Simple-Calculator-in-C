Uploaded first C program, not finished. It's a simple calculator that runs in-terminal. Wanted to try out C as it's considered a "Low-Level" language in many circles. Plus, since C does not GAF about memory I want to be a bit cheeky with other potential ""PROJECTS"" ;)

//TODO: Have the menu loop

//TODO: Have the system pause once sum is printed, not using the "system("pause") function as this is system dependent, better to create a custom variable using getchar()

//TODO: Add more complex mathematic functions or algos (gotta learn more math ugh but it's cool)
